# team-profile-generator
The contents of this repository are a Node.js CLI application for generating team profile HTML pages. The application will prompt users for information on the team manager. After that, it will allow the user to add Engineers and Interns to the team. Once the user is finished adding members, they can select finish and a team profile page called index.html will be produced.

The repository also contains tests for the 4 main classes (Employee, Engineer, Manager, and Intern)
